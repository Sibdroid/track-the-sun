# track-the-sun
A Dash-based web application to track the sunrises, sunsets and day lengths.

The application consists of two files:
1. suntime.py: calculates the sunset & sunrise time, as well as day length;
2. dynamic-graph.py: visualizes the data in a nice, human-understandable way. 

In order to run, the application requires the following libraries (used versions stated).
1. Plotly 5.14.0;
2. Dash 2.9.2;
3. Geocoder 1.38.1.
